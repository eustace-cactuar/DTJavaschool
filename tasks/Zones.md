# Zones #

[Back to readme](/README.md)

### General description ###

That's the case from a real project.

City is divided by transport zones and a user can ask for specific zones.
The task is to understand (based on initial state of the zones in the city) whether
the user can travel through requested zones.

Initial state is defined by a list of Zone objects. Each Zone object may contain a list of it's neighbours.
Link is unidirectional but can be used as bidirectional.

For example, if zone A has a neighbour B then zones A and B are considered as connected, even if B doesn't have A as a neighbour.

Let's imagine the following state: A-B-C-D-E. Some samples:

* Journey with zones A, B and C is allowed
* Journey with zones A, B and D is not allowed, because in order to travel with these zones the user has to go through zone C
* Journey with zones A, B, C and D is allowed
  

### Input and expected output ###
* Input : List of zones (city map) and list of requested zones
* Output : true if the user can travel through requested zones, false otherwise
